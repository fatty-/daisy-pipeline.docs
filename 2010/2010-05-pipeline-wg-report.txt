The Pipeline 2 "TTS-base Production" and "Braille Production" sub-working groups are proposed in the charter for the first phase of the Pipeline 2 project [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-pipeline/wiki/ProjectCharter#A.4.1_Braille_in_DAISY_working_group].
The working groups are open to all organizations, they are not restricted to the organizations that already have decided to contribute to Pipeline 2 core development. 

Two separate calls for participation to the Pipeline 2 Working Group have been sent to the DAISY mailing lists in early April. Each call included a document describing:
 * the scope and objectives of the Pipeline 2 project
 * the lifespan of the Working Group
 * the participation requirements and
 * the foreseen means of communications.

Those interested in participating were requested to send an email by April 30th to the lead of the Pipeline 2 project Romain Deltour (rdeltour@gmail.com) with cc to Markus Gylling (markus.gylling@gmail.com), George Kerscher (kerscher@montana.com), and Bernhard Heinser (b.heinser@sbszh.ch).

Note: The April 30th deadline was given as an incentive to receive timely answers, but it is still possible to join the working groups after this date.

Participation to the "TTS Production" working group mostly consists of brainstorming and preparatory work for a total redesign of the Pipeline 1 Narrator, putting the focus on better extensibility (e.g. call of remote TTS services) and standards support (SSML, PLS). 
Upon confirmation of the Pipeline 2 project, a first conference call will be scheduled in June 2010 to introduce the participants and refine the WG objectives.

This working group is established to bring about a unified approach to the inclusion of automated braille output in production work flow, an uncontested objective embedded in a broader Braille Initiative. Participation will mostly consist of brainstorming and preparatory work for future Pipeline developments and will *not* include heavy development work.	
Upon confirmation of the Pipeline 2 project, a first conference call will be scheduled in June 2010. The first tasks of the group will be identifying a group leader and refining the group objectives as well as aligning them with the overall Pipeline 2 project objectives.
