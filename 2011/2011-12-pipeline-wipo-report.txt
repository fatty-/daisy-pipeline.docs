== Status ==

=== 1.0 release ===

The 1.0 version was released on October 3. A 1.0.1 version was released soon after to fixed an issue that was occurring only under very special circumstances (on Japanese Windows versions).

A [http://www.daisy.org/forums/pipeline2 discussion forum] for handling user feedback and requests for support has been created. Several threads have been started and support has been taken care of by the developers team. 

=== F2F Meeting ===

The developers had a successful 4 days face-to-face meeting in Nancy (France), hosted by Romain Deltour for the DAISY Consortium. The agenda focused primarily on the web application and online deployment use cases.

=== Web Service ===

It has been decided that the Web Service API will be made the primary and recommended entry point to the framework. Work has started to refactor the command line interface as a local client to the Web Service.

Functional requirements for the support of batch job processing have been identified.

=== Web UI ===

Different web application frameworks have been experimented and it was decided to adopt the Java-based Play! Framework for web UI development.

Cloud-based deployment was experimented on Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) platform.

=== Processing modules ===

Work has started on the DTBook to EPUB 3 conversion. The next developments will focus on improved EPUB 3 support, notably on the HTML to EPUB 3 conversion and on the identification of functional requirements for producing TTS-ready EPUBs.

=== Adoption ===
