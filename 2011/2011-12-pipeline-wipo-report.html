			DAISY Pipeline Progress Report, October 2011 to December 2011
		</h1>
		<h1>
			Executive summary
		</h1>
		<p>
			The second development phase officially started, the project charter has been approved by the DAISY Board at the SÃ£o Paulo meeting in November 2011.
		</p>
		<p>
			The developers team had a successful face-to-face meeting where several strategical and technical decisions have been taken, notably about the web service and web application development.
		</p>
		<p>
			A release is planned in early 2012 consisting mostly in consolidation of the back-end framework and the DTBook to EPUB 3 conversion.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Report
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Milestones since October 2010
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>October 3: 1.0 released
			</li>
			<li>October 13: 1.0.1 released
			</li>
			<li>November 2: Phase 2 Charter approved by the DAISY Board

		<h2>
			Status
		</h2>
		<h3>
			1.0 release
		</h3>
		<p>
			The 1.0 version was released on October 3. A 1.0.1 version was released soon after to fixed an issue that was occurring only under very special circumstances (on Japanese Windows versions).
		</p>
		<p>
			A <a href="http://www.daisy.org/forums/pipeline2">discussion forum</a> for handling user feedback and requests for support has been created. Several threads have been started and support has been taken care of by the developers team.
		</p>
		<h3>
			F2F Meeting
		</h3>
		<p>
			The developers had a successful 4 days face-to-face meeting in Nancy (France), hosted by Romain Deltour for the DAISY Consortium. The agenda focused primarily on the web application and online deployment use cases.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Web Service
		</h3>
		<p>
			It has been decided that the Web Service API will be made the primary and recommended entry point to the framework. Work has started to refactor the command line interface as a local client to the Web Service.
		</p>
		<p>
			Functional requirements for the support of batch job processing have been identified.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Web UI
		</h3>
		<p>
			Different web application frameworks have been experimented and it was decided to adopt the Java-based Play! Framework for web UI development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cloud-based deployment was experimented on Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) platform.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Processing modules
		</h3>
		<p>
			Work has started on the DTBook to EPUB 3 conversion. The next developments will focus on improved EPUB 3 support, notably on the HTML to EPUB 3 conversion and on the identification of functional requirements for producing TTS-ready EPUBs.
		</p>
